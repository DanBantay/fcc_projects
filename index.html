				<ul>
					<li>
						There had been many folk accounts surrounding Lapulapuâ€™s origin. One
						oral tradition is that the Sugbuanons of Opong was once ruled by
						datu named Mangal and later succeeded by his son named Lapulapu.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another is from oral chronicles from the reign of the last king of
						Cebu, Rajah Tupas (d. 1565). This was compiled and written in
						Baybayin in the book Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik ("Glide on, Odes
						to Our History") in 1952 by Jovito Abellana. The chronicle records
						the founding of the Rajahnate of Cebu by a certain Sri Lumay (also
						known as Rajamuda Lumaya), who was a prince from the Hindu Chola
						dynasty of Sumatra. His sons, Sri Alho and Sri Ukob, ruled the
						neighboring communities of Sialo and Nahalin, respectively. The
						islands they were in were collectively known as Pulua Kang Dayang or
						Kangdaya (literally "[the islands] of the lady"). Sri Lumay was
						known for his strict policies in defending against Moro raiders and
						slavers from Mindanao. His use of scorched earth tactics to repel
						invaders gave rise to the name Kang Sri Lumayng Sugbo (literally
						"that of Sri Lumay's great fire") to the town, which was later
						shortened to Sugbo ("conflagration").
					</li>
					<li>
						Upon his death in a battle against the raiders, Sri Lumay was
						succeeded by his youngest son, Sri Bantug, who ruled from the region
						of Singhapala (literally "lion city"), now Mabolo in modern Cebu
						City. Sri Bantug died of a disease during an epidemic and was
						succeeded by his son Rajah Humabon (also known as Sri Humabon or
						Rajah Humabara).[17] During Humabon's reign, the region had become
						an important trading center. The harbors of Sugbo became known
						colloquially as sinibuayng hingpit ("the place for trading"),
						shortened to sibu or sibo ("to trade"), from which the modern name
						"Cebu" originates.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the midnight of April 27, 1521, Magellan led a force of around
						sixty Spaniards and twenty to thirty war boats (karakoa) of
						Humabon's warriors from Cebu. They arrived in Mactan three hours
						before dawn. However, because of the presence of rock outcroppings
						and coral reefs, Magellan's ships could not land on the shores of
						Mactan. Their ships were forced to anchor "two crossbow flights"
						away from the beach. According to Antonio Pigafetta, they faced
						around 1,500 warriors of Lapulapu armed with iron swords,[note 1]
						bows, and "bamboo" spears.[note 2] Magellan repeated his offer not
						to attack them if Lapulapu swore fealty to Rajah Humabon, obeyed the
						Spanish king, and paid tribute, which Lapulapu again rejected. At
						the taunting request of Lapulapu, the battle did not begin until
						morning. Magellan, perhaps hoping to impress Humabon's warriors with
						the superiority of European armor and weapons, told Humabon's
						warriors to remain in their balangay. Magellan and forty-nine of the
						heavily armored Spaniards (armed with lances, swords, crossbows, and
						muskets) waded ashore to meet Lapulapu's forces. They set fire to a
						few houses on the shore in an attempt to scare them. Instead,
						Lapulapu's warriors became infuriated and charged. Two Spaniards
						were killed immediately in the fighting, and Magellan was wounded in
						the leg with a poisoned arrow. He ordered a retreat, which most of
						his men followed except for a few who remained to protect him.
						However, he was recognized as the captain by the natives, whereupon
						he became the focus of the attack. Outnumbered and encumbered by
						their armor, Magellan's forces were quickly overwhelmed. Magellan
						and several of his men were killed, and the rest escaped to the
						waiting ships
